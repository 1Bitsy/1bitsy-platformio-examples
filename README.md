This repository contains example projects using the [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org) IDE.

Each subdirectory is dedicated to a framework that can be used with the 1Bitsy development boards.

The goal of this repository is to make the entry into the 1Bitsy and Black Magic Probe development as easy as possible.

Pull requests with additional easy to understand examples are very welcome.
